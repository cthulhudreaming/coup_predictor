For my final project, I am investigating one of the core questions of my
fall Freshmen Seminar: Are democracies or autocracies more vulnerable to 
espionage and subversion?

I gathered four datasets:

The Polity IV dataset from the Polity IV Project, led by Monty Marshall and 
Ted Robert Gurr. This dataset assigns each country a numerical value based on
the spectrum of autocratic regimes to democratic regimes. It ranges from -10, 
which denotes a hereditary monarchy, to +10 which denotes a consolidated
democracy.

The Autocratic Regime dataset, created by Barbara Geddes, Joseph Wright, and
Erica Frantz and published in 2014. This dataset examines the particular 
features of autocratic regimes.

The All Political Regimes dataset created by Barbara Geddes, Joseph Wright, and
Erica Frantz and published in 2014. This dataset examines the particular
features of every regime type.

The Coup D'Etat dataset from the Coup D'Etat Project. This project tracks 
coups d'etat in 165 post-WWII, and categorizes each one by success or failure,
in addition to coup attemps and conspiracies.

I plan to first join the Polity-IV, Autocratic regime, and all political regimes
datasets together by country name to obtain the regime type of each country and
its features, in addition to their polity scores.

I will then join the coup data to this dataset, and the I will analyze which 
variables have the largest impact on coup attempts and success by using linear
regression.
