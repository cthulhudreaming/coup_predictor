# Project summary

The goal of this project is to determine what factors determine the 
success of a coup d'etat. Edward Luttwak, author of "Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook",
argued that coup success is determined by a country's level of economic development, political 
independence, and government centralization of power. I will be using these indicators to predict the 
likelihood of a successful coup d'etat in a country./
